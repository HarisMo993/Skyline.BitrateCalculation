# Skyline.BitrateCalculation without SLC.LIB.Automation NuGet package

This project I was working on was an assignment from Skyline Communications. Likewise, it is about bitrate calculation where I had json data with the help of which I had to add additional RX and TX bitrates. The task was successfully completed, and with this file you would go through the work on the task.


## Task Desctiption

### Bitrate calculation exercise

Imagine the vendor Arista had a video transcoder known as X-Video. For each network interface included in XVideo, the API returns the number of transmitted and received octets at a determined moment. Our customer 
Fox is using several of that equipment and asked Skyline to add the respective bitrates, Rx and Tx, to the current 
driver.
Exercise: parse the following JSON and implement a method to calculate the requested bitrates for both Rx and 
Tx considering a pooling rate of 2Hz.
Use the programming language at your preference. C# would be an added-value.
